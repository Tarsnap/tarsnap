OS-specific packaging bits for tarsnap
======================================

This directory contains bits to allow tarsnap to fit into operating system
package management systems.  I don't have access to all of these systems,
so please email me (at <cperciva@tarsnap.com>) if there are any problems
with these bits or if you can provide packaging bits for another OS.

Debian
------

To build a Debian package:
# ln -s pkg/debian .
# dpkg-buildpackage

Then to install it:
# dpkg -i tarsnap-<version>_<arch>.deb

Arch Linux
----------

There is a PKGBUILD file for an earlier version of tarsnap in pkg/archlinux.
I can't include a PKGBUILD for the current version of tarsnap because the
PKGBUILD file contains the hash of the tarball which contains the PKGBUILD
file.  If you're running Arch Linux, you should know what to do with the
PKGBUILD file; but you may wish to change the pkgver=, md5sums=, and
sha256sums= lines so that you get the latest version of tarsnap.

There may be a newer version of the PKGBUILD file at
  http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=22963

  http://slackbuilds.org/repository/12.2/system/tarsnap/

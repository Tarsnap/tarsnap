tarsnap (1.0.36) unstable; urgency=high

  * New version of tarsnap fixes two security vulnerabilities: a corrupt
    archive could result in tarsnap allocating a large amount of memory or
    crashing; and very long object paths can result in a potentially
    exploitable one-byte buffer overflow.
  * A bug which caused tarsnap to crash if its first DNS lookup fails is fixed.
  * A bug which caused tarsnap to exit with "Callbacks uninitialized" when
    running on a dual-stack network if the first IP stack it attempted to use
    failed to connect is fixed.
  * tarsnap -c --dry-run can now run without a keyfile.
  * tarsnap now automatically detects and uses AESNI and SSE2 cpu features.

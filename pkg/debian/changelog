tarsnap (1.0.39-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix a division-by-zero crash when reading corrupt password-encrypted
    tarsnap key files.
  * Fix two crashes arising from maliciously-crafted archives included via
    the tarsnap @archive directive.
  * Fix an abort trap which complained about files with a negative modification
    time.  (This assertion occured after the archive is stored, so no user data
    was at risk.)

tarsnap (1.0.38-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New version of tarsnap brings several new features and warnings, and
    OpenSSL 1.1 support.
  * tarsnap now accepts an --initialize-cachedir command, which is intended for
    the GUI and is not needed for command-line usage.
  * tarsnap now applies --humanize-numbers to the SIGINFO "progress" output.
  * tarsnap now gives a warning for --configfile /nosuchfile.
  * tarsnap now accepts --iso-dates, which prints file and directory dates as
    yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss in "list archive" mode.  This can be cancelled with
    --no-iso-dates.
  * the ./configure --with-conf-no-sample flag causes in the sample config file
    to be installed as tarsnap.conf instead of tarsnap.conf.sample.  This may
    result in overwriting an existing tarsnap.conf file.
  * tarsnap now accepts --force-resources to force the decryption of a
    passphrase-encrypted key file to proceed even if it is anticipated to
    require an excessive amount of memory or CPU time.  This can be cancelled
    with --no-force-resources.
  * tarsnap now displays 'Deleting archive "foo"' when deleting a single archive
    in verbose mode.  (The former behaviour was to print that message only when
    multiple archives were being deleted by a single tarsnap command.)
  * tarsnap now accepts --archive-names filename, which reads a list of
    archive names from a file in addition to any -f options.

tarsnap (1.0.37-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New version of tarsnap brings several new features and warnings.
  * tarsnap-key(gen|mgmt|regen) now accept a --passphrase-time option,
    which specifies the duration to be spent on computing the derived
    keys used for encrypting the tarsnap key file.
  * tarsnap now accepts a --keep-going option when deleting or printing
    statistics about multiple archives.
  * tarsnap-keymgmt now accepts a --print-key-permissions option for
    listing the permissions contained in a key file.
  * tarsnap --print-stats now accepts a --csv-file option for printing
    statistics in comma-separated-value format.
  * tarsnap now accepts a --verify-config command which exits silently
    after checking the configuration file(s) for syntax errors.
  * tarsnap now looks for a server named "v1-0-0-server.tarsnap.com"
    instead of the historic "betatest-server.tarsnap.com" hostname.
    This should have no user-visible effect in most configurations.
  * tarsnap now correctly warns if a sparse extract fails due to hardlinks.
  * tarsnap now prints a warning if creating an empty archive.
  * Many minor bug fixes.

tarsnap (1.0.36) unstable; urgency=high

  * New version of tarsnap fixes two security vulnerabilities: a corrupt
    archive could result in tarsnap allocating a large amount of memory or
    crashing; and very long object paths can result in a potentially
    exploitable one-byte buffer overflow.
  * A bug which caused tarsnap to crash if its first DNS lookup fails is fixed.
  * A bug which caused tarsnap to exit with "Callbacks uninitialized" when
    running on a dual-stack network if the first IP stack it attempted to use
    failed to connect is fixed.
  * tarsnap -c --dry-run can now run without a keyfile.
  * tarsnap now automatically detects and uses AESNI and SSE2 cpu features.

tarsnap (1.0.35) unstable; urgency=medium

    on 64-bit platforms is fixed.
  * Terminal settings are now restored if tarsnap is killed with ^C while
    reading an account password or a keyfile passphrase.
  * A large amount of library code has been restructured into an open
    source "libcperciva" library.

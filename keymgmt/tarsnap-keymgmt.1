.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
reads the provided key files and writes a new key file
containing only the keys required for the operations
specified via the
.Fl r
(list and extract archives),
.Fl w
(write archives),
.Fl d
(delete archives), and
.Fl -nuke
flags.
Note that
.Fl d
implies
.Fl r
since it is impossible to delete an individual archive without
being able to read it; while a key file generated with
.Fl -nuke
can be used to delete all the archives stored, but not individual
archives.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
generates cryptographic keys, registers with the
tarsnap server, and writes a key file for use with
.Xr tarsnap 1 .
.Pp
The
.Fl -keyfile Ar key-file
option specifies the name of the file in which to write the newly-generated
keys.
The
.Fl -user Ar user-name
option specifies the name (i.e. email address) of the Tarsnap account.
The
.Fl -machine Ar machine-name
option specifies a name which will be displayed in accounting reports so that
you can see how much data each machine is storing.
.Pp
If the
.Fl -passphrased
option is specified, the user will be prompted to enter a passphrase (twice)
to be used to encrypt the key file.
.Pp
If the
.Fl -passphrase-mem Ar maxmem
option is specified, a maximum of
.Ar maxmem
bytes of RAM will be used in the scrypt key derivation function to
encrypt the key file; it may be necessary to set this option if a key
file is being generated on a system with far more RAM than the system
on which the key file will be used.
.Pp
If the
.Fl -passphrase-time Ar maxtime
option is specified, a maximum of approximately
.Ar maxtime
seconds will be used in the scrypt key derivation function to
encrypt the key file.
.Pp
The
.Fl -version
option prints the version number of
.Nm ,
then exits.

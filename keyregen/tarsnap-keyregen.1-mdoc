.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
generates a set of cryptographic keys which are compatible
with an existing set of cryptographic keys, registers with
the tarsnap server, and writes a key file for use with
.Xr tarsnap-recrypt 1
and
.Xr tarsnap 1 .
The term "compatible"
here means that it is possible to re-encrypt archives stored with
the first set of keys to be stored with the second set of keys.  This is
required because Tarsnap has some keys which need to stay the same when
re-encrypting data; otherwise, existing archives will become unreadable and
cannot be used for deduplication.
.Pp
The
.Fl -keyfile ,
.Fl -user ,
.Fl -machine ,
and
.Fl -oldkey
parameters are all required.
.Pp
If the
.Fl -passphrased
option is specified, the user will be prompted to enter a passphrase (twice)
to be used to encrypt the key file.
.Pp
If the
.Fl -passphrase-mem Ar maxmem
option is specified, a maximum of
.Ar maxmem
bytes of RAM will be used in the scrypt key derivation function to
encrypt the key file; it may be necessary to set this option if a key
file is being generated on a system with far more RAM than the system
on which the key file will be used.
.Pp
If the
.Fl -passphrase-time Ar maxtime
option is specified, a maximum of approximately
.Ar maxtime
seconds will be used in the scrypt key derivation function to
encrypt the key file.

 * that are supported by "pax interchange" format.  However, GNU, ustar,
 * cpio, and other variants don't support these features, so they're not an
 * excruciatingly high priority right now.
 *
 * TODO: "pax interchange" format allows essentially arbitrary
 * key/value attributes to be attached to any entry.  Supporting
 * such extensions may make this library useful for special
 * applications (e.g., a package manager could attach special
 * package-management attributes to each entry).  There are tricky
 * API issues involved, so this is not going to happen until
 * there's a real demand for it.
 *
 * TODO: Design a good API for handling sparse files.
